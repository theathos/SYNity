[synity, by RIGINAL]  
Sane syntax in the parlance of our times.
  
Synity aims to make a simple unifying syntax for interactive prompts, shells, and interfaces in general. If this project gains sufficient support, the aim is also to standardize the syntax as a simpler interpreted translation of the obscure and cryptic parts of programming languages.
  
Memorizing or referencing unique utility/function names, arguments, options, flags, and positional order in yet another shell/language is what we want to avoid. The design intent is to be an optional abstraction to the actual interface (e.g. bash, zsh, cmd, powershell, python, ruby, perl), with different levels of abstraction from a simplified but expanded longform to an abbreviated expert shortform helper aliases.
  
The base level abstraction should align with the simple voice commands given to smart devices like Alexa, Siri, and Google, using opinionated sane defaults that align with smart device user expectations for voice commands.
  
Shutdown example:  
<=original> sudo shutdown -r now  
<=base> please reboot -now  
<=expert> sudo shutd -r -0

### Make Linux more user friendly with this collection of **Bash functions**!

They provide **commands that should be in Linux** by default, or just **abbreviations of commands** that are provided, but are so commonly used that they deserve a shorter name and/or a set of configurable **“sensible” options**. When abbreviated command is executed, these predefined options are combined with the actual ones. Also most of the commands send their **output to a pager** if it doesn't fit the screen.

Collection was made for **Debian** based Linux (**Ubuntu**, **Mint**, ...) with **Gnome** desktop environment, but most commands will work on any system that has _Bash_ shell and _GNU Coreutils_ installed. For **OS X** see [instructions](README.md#how-to-run-on-os-x).

There are currently **211 commands**.

How To Rename Commands
----------------------
* Check if name is already taken by running: `$ type <name>`
* Open **`.standardrc`** located in your home directory and add a new name in front of function's description.
* Save and run: `$ bash`

Misc
----
* Usually if function only makes Linux command easier to use, either by using a few “sensible” options, or just by sending output to a pager (if necessary), then it has the same name as command, but with number `1` appended at the end. Some examples are: `ps1`, `mkdir1`, `pgrep1`, `tree1`. Options for this commands are defined at the bottom of [`standardrc`](standard_rc#L328-L358) and can be customized by preference.

* **`cp`**, **`mv`**, **`rm`** and **`rmdir`** are the only functions that override already existing commands. They are all run in interactive mode, meaning you get asked for conformation before any destructive operation. If you want to execute them without this prompting, use `-f` (force) option. `rmdir` also deletes the directory contents.

* Command-line completions are automatically assigned to functions, depending on what commands they use.

* Commands for accessing the “framework”:
  * **`ty COMMAND`** – prints function's body (short for `type`),
  * **`rc`** – opens configuration file (`~/.standardrc`) in default editor,
  * **`fu`** – opens `standard_functions` in default editor.

How It Works
------------
After installation the “framework” consists of three files:

* [**`standard_functions`**](standard_functions): It contains _Bash_ functions with long descriptive names. It is located in projects directory.

* User's [**`.standardrc`**](standard_rc) file: Configuration file that specifies short names for functions.  Also defines [options](standard_rc#L328-L358) that this functions use when they call specific commands. It is located in user's home directory.

* Automatically generated **`aliases`** file: Contains functions with short names that call functions with longer names (as defined in configuration file). It also assigns appropriate command-line completions to the short functions. It is located in `~/.standard_aliases` directory.

Every time new _Bash_ shell is started, "framework" checks if any changes were made to the functions or configuration file and if so, it generates new `aliases` file.

How to run on OS X
------------------
* Install _Developer Tools_ by running:
```
make
```

* Install _Homebrew_:
```
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

brew install coreutils
echo '. .bashrc' >> .profile
echo 'PATH="/usr/local/opt/coreutils/libexec/gnubin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
bash
```

* Install other _GNU_ programs (optional):
```
brew tap homebrew/dupes
brew install grep --with-default-names
brew install findutils --with-default-names
brew install tree
...
```
